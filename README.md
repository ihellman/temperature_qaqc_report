# Temperature Sensor QAQC Report

This repository contains a RMarkdown report to be used for QAQC on stream temperature data and a separte script to generate multiple reports at once.  Sample input data is provided in the data_input folder and a "key" to tie specific sensors to specific sites is in the metadata folder.  The report can be generated manually per basin or through the iterator script.
